# Deep Learning and NLP Analysis of Northrop Grumman Corporation's 10K Report

This project applies deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the 10K financial reports of Northrop Grumman Corporation. It aims to extract insights by focusing on document similarity, key terms, phrases, topic modeling, and trend analysis etc.

``Includes 50 code cells, 43 of which contain outputs that showcase the analysis results and insights derived from the 10K reports.``

## Project Features

The notebook is structured into several main sections:

- **Document Similarity Analysis**: Implements algorithms to identify documents that are closely related based on specified keywords, aiding in understanding the thematic consistency or deviation across reports.

- **Key Terms and Phrases Analysis**: Employs NLP methods to pinpoint and scrutinize the significance, frequency, and contextual usage of selected terms and phrases within the 10K reports, highlighting their impact and relevance.

- **Topic Modeling**: Applies topic modeling techniques to discover and categorize the main themes present in the textual data of the 10K reports, offering insights into the strategic focuses and concerns of the corporation over time.

- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzes the evolution of topics, terms, and their associated sentiments across different reporting periods, providing a longitudinal view of the company's narrative and strategic direction.
