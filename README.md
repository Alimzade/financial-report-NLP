# Deep Learning and NLP Analysis of Northrop Grumman Corporation's 10K Report

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that leverages deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the 10K financial reports of Northrop Grumman Corporation. The analysis aims to uncover insights from the textual data within these reports, focusing on document similarity, key terms and phrases, topic modeling, and trends over time.

## Project Structure

The notebook is structured into several main sections:

1. **Dependencies** - Lists all the necessary libraries and frameworks required to run the notebook.
2. **Data Preparation** - Covers the preprocessing steps to prepare the 10K report texts for analysis.
3. **Task 1: Find Close Documents to Words Method** - Implements and discusses a method for finding documents closely related to a set of specified words.
4. **Task 2: Words of Interest Analysis** - Analyzes specific words of interest within the documents, examining their significance and context.
5. **Task 3: Fit Topic Model Method** - Details the approach for fitting a topic model to the documents, aiming to uncover the main themes within the 10K reports.
6. **Task 4: Topics of Interest Analysis** - Explores the identified topics, discussing their relevance and evolution over time.

The notebook includes 50 code cells, 43 of which contain outputs that showcase the analysis results and insights derived from the 10K reports.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, along with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and the following libraries:

- [Library/Dependency names here: e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, gensim, etc.]

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook
After installing the dependencies, launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab using:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or for JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Then navigate to the `Deep_Learning_and_NLP_10k_report_analysis_of_Northrop_Grumman_Corporation.ipynb` file and open it.


- You can also use Google Colab to work with jupyter notebooks.
